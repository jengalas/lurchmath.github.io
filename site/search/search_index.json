In the previous tutorial page, we entered only expository math, not meaningful math. If we asked Lurch to check our work, it would give us no feedback at all, because it knows to ignore content we've explicitly called \"expository.\" Why two types of math? Students will almost always want to use meaningful math only, so that Lurch will read and grade all of their work. But instructors may want to enter a mix of meaningful and expository math. For example, if an instructor is defining a new set of axioms, and they want to intersperse examples that explain the axioms, they don't want Lurch to misinterpret the examples as axioms, or as student work to be graded. (The instructor might even give examples of what you can't do with the axioms!) So they would use meaningful math for the axioms, but expository math for the examples. Exercise: Meaningful math In the Lurch application below, click the Insert menu and choose \"Expression.\" In the dialog that pops up, type a simple expression, like \\(x<0\\) . Click OK to place your math into the document. Important details about expressions You have surely noticed that the expression you just added is surrounded in a blue-ish border. This border distinguishes meaningful content from non-meaningful content, and makes it clear which portions of your document Lurch is paying attention to. We'll talk more about this decoration (and how to hide it when you want to) later. To edit your new content, you have the same options as you did for expository math ; you can click it or place your cursor on it and hit enter. When adding or editing math expressions, you are not restricted to using only the equation editor. Under the Edit menu, find the Preferences option (all the way at the bottom---you may need to scroll down). In its \"Math content\" tab, you can select which type of expression editor to use, from these options: Beginner: the default you used above, a standard equation editor widget (thanks to the open-source tool MathLive ) Intermediate: incorporates both the equation editor for those who wish to use it and a text box that uses a special Lurch notation. That notation is partially documented here . Advanced: for those who have mastered Lurch notation, a minimalist dialog that lets you stay in the flow of your document Is lurch grading my math now? No, but that's the very next thing!

In the previous tutorial page, we entered only expository math, not meaningful math. If we asked Lurch to check our work, it would give us no feedback at all, because it knows to ignore content we've explicitly called \"expository.\"","title":"Two types of mathematical content"},{"location":"tut-03-meaningful-math/#why-two-types-of-math","text":"Students will almost always want to use meaningful math only, so that Lurch will read and grade all of their work. But instructors may want to enter a mix of meaningful and expository math. For example, if an instructor is defining a new set of axioms, and they want to intersperse examples that explain the axioms, they don't want Lurch to misinterpret the examples as axioms, or as student work to be graded. (The instructor might even give examples of what you can't do with the axioms!) So they would use meaningful math for the axioms, but expository math for the examples. Exercise: Meaningful math In the Lurch application below, click the Insert menu and choose \"Expression.\" In the dialog that pops up, type a simple expression, like \\(x<0\\) . Click OK to place your math into the document.","title":"Why two types of math?"},{"location":"tut-03-meaningful-math/#important-details-about-expressions","text":"You have surely noticed that the expression you just added is surrounded in a blue-ish border. This border distinguishes meaningful content from non-meaningful content, and makes it clear which portions of your document Lurch is paying attention to. We'll talk more about this decoration (and how to hide it when you want to) later. To edit your new content, you have the same options as you did for expository math ; you can click it or place your cursor on it and hit enter. When adding or editing math expressions, you are not restricted to using only the equation editor. Under the Edit menu, find the Preferences option (all the way at the bottom---you may need to scroll down). In its \"Math content\" tab, you can select which type of expression editor to use, from these options: Beginner: the default you used above, a standard equation editor widget (thanks to the open-source tool MathLive ) Intermediate: incorporates both the equation editor for those who wish to use it and a text box that uses a special Lurch notation.
