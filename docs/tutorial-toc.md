# Lurch Tutorial

This tutorial is for the Lurch application that is
[online here](http://lurchmath.github.io/lurchmath).

!!! warning

    The app's documentation is not at all complete yet!
    It is just beginning!

    In fact, at this point, there is almost nothing here!
    There is only this tutorial, and it is far from complete.

    We are actively developing Lurch daily during Spring 2024,
    and if you check back often, you will find new documentation arriving regularly.
