# Lurch is a word processor

## It is also much more, but it *is* a word processor.

While its main goal is to be able to check the reasoning in students'
mathematical arguments, its foundation is a word processor.  A copy of the Lurch
application is embedded below.  You can see that it has all of the basic word
processing functionality, including headings, fonts, and so on.

## Under the hood

Lurch is built on the pre-existing, open-source project
[TinyMCE](https://www.tiny.cloud/), which is used in literally millions of other
web-based projects.  It is a mature product that is easy to extend with new
functionality, which enables us to build Lurch with TinyMCE as the foundation.
