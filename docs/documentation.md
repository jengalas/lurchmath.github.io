# Lurch Documentation

This documentation is for the Lurch application that is
[online here](http://lurchmath.github.io/lurchmath).

***This documentation is not at all complete yet!  It is just beginning!***

***In fact, at this point, there is almost nothing here!***

We are actively developing Lurch daily during Spring 2024,
and if you check back often, you will find new documentation arriving regularly.

## Example of Lurch checking reasoning

Below you can see a live copy of the Lurch application embedded in this
documentation page.  It shows a trivial example of Lurch checking the work of
the document author.  A green check mark is applied to the second *P*, because
it is a statement, and thus needs to be checked.  Since it follows from the
assumption on the previous line, the green check indicates that it is correct.
The assumption does not get a check mark, since it was not a step of reasoning,
but just an assumption.

What if we `assume P`?

The simplest conclusion we can draw from that is just `P` itself.
