# Old versions of Lurch

Lurch was first conceived in about 1995, but work was only sporadic and informal
for most of the time since then.  From 2008--2012, an intense period of work was
supported by NSF DUE CCLI grant #0736644, followed by a break for redesign, and
then reinvigorated work from about 2019 onward, resulting in
[the latest version](index.md).

***This page is for historical purposes only, and lists old versions of the
software no longer used or suppored.***  Again, we encourage users seeking the
current version to visit [our main page](index.md).

They are listed in chronological order.

## Desktop application, 2008--2014

Work on this project was supported by NSF DUE CCLI grant #0736644 from
2008-2012, resulting in a desktop application for Windows, Mac, and Linux
systems.  That desktop app has several drawbacks that motivated our work on the
[latest version](index.md), most notably very slow computation and a less than
reliable user interface.  Again, it's mentioned here for historical purposes
only; we recommend using the newest version.

## Lurch Web Platform, c2017

Our first attempt to move our desktop application to the web resulted in a suite
of tools for web-based word processing with semantic features embedded in the
document and feedback graphics overlaid on top of the document.  Subsequent
improvements in web-based word processors (particularly TinyMCE) and our own
decisions to streamline our design made it so that we did not end up using most
of these tools in the long run.  We mention them here for archival purposes
only.

 * [First attempt at moving Lurch to the web](http://lurchmath.github.io/lurch),
   no longer actively developed or supported, including small example apps that
   use that web platform, documented [here](http://lurchmath.github.io/lurch/site/example-apps/).
 * [A partial implementaton](http://lurchmath.github.io/openmath-js) of the [OpenMath standard in JavaScript](http://www.openmath.org/standard/)
 * [cloud-storage](http://lurchmath.github.io/cloud-storage) - A JavaScript
   interface to cloud storage providers, used in our app for saving Lurch
   documents to Dropbox
 * [loadsave-plugin](http://lurchmath.github.io/loadsave-plugin) - A TinyMCE
   plugin providing a UI and other tools for loading and saving documents
   written in the editor
