# About Lurch

See [the main page](index.md) for a description of the software's purpose.

## Authors

The Lurch project was created and has been principally designed and developed by
[Nathan Carter](https://faculty.bentley.edu/profile/ncarter) and
[Ken Monks](http://monks.scranton.edu), beginning informally in 1999 and
continuing to the present.

Major time was invested between 2008--2012 while supported by NSF DUE
CCLI grant #0736644, and from 2018--present as part of a major update.
