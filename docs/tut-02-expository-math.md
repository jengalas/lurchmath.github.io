# Adding mathematical content

The simplest way to enter mathematical content into Lurch is to use either
LaTeX notation (for those who know it) or an equation editor (for those
unfamiliar with LaTeX).

!!! note "Exercise: Add some math"

    1. In the Lurch application below, click the Insert menu and choose
       "Expository math."
    2. In the dialog that pops up, use either the LaTeX input box or
       the equation editor below it, whichever you prefer.
       For example, you might type the LaTeX code `1-x^2` to represent $1-x^2$.
    3. Click OK to place your math into the document.

<div class='lurch-embed' width='100%' height='300px'>
</div>

## Editing math you've added

To later edit your new mathematical expression, you can either

 - click the expression or
 - move your cursor over the expression with the arrow keys on the keyboard
   (which will highlight the expression) and then press Enter on the keyboard.

Both options open the same dialog box you had when adding the math, but now for
editing it instead.

## Staying in sync

You have probably noticed that the two input methods stay in sync with one
another.  As you type LaTeX, it is automatically rendered in the equation
editor, and if you use the equation editor, it updates the LaTeX code box as
well.  This is useful in two ways.

For those who type LaTeX, it's nice to see a live preview, to be sure that you
have typed what you intended.  For those who use the equation editor, it
provides a simple way to learn the corresponding LaTeX syntax, if the user
wants to do so.

## Is Lurch grading my math?
