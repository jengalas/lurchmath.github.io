# Welcome to Lurch Math

The Lurch Math Project brings together several different software components
to create a web based word processor that is capable of checking reasoning,
especially for mathematical proofs.  Currently Lurch Math is comprised of
the following subprojects.

 * [lurch](http://lurchmath.github.io/lurch) - The Lurch app itself, a
   mathematical word processor that checks the reasoning in users'
   documents, especially for mathematical proofs
 * [lde](http://github.com/lurchmath/lde) - The Lurch Deductive Engine, the
   brain behind checking user's proofs
 * [openmath-js](http://lurchmath.github.io/openmath-js) - An
   implementation of (most of) the [OpenMath
   Standard](http://www.openmath.org/standard/) in JavaScript
 * [earley-parser](http://lurchmath.github.io/earley-parser) - A JavaScript
   implementation of the [Earley parsing
   algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earley_parser)
 * [first-order-matching](http://lurchmath.github.io/first-order-matching) -
   A limited JavaScript implementation of a matching algorithm for
   expressions of first-order logic
 * [cloud-storage](http://lurchmath.github.io/cloud-storage) - A JavaScript
   interface to cloud storage providers, used in our app for saving Lurch
   documents to Dropbox
 * [loadsave-plugin](http://lurchmath.github.io/loadsave-plugin) - A TinyMCE
   plugin providing a UI and other tools for loading and saving documents
   written in the editor

There are also several example uses of the Lurch Web Platform (the suite of
tools listed above), and you can find them in [the documentation for the
Lurch project](http://lurchmath.github.io/lurch/site/example-apps/).

More documentation will be added here in the future. For now you can [view
