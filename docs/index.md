# The Lurch Project

***Lurch* is a word processor designed to check the reasoning in proofs,
specifically the types of proofs that students do in an introduction to proofs
course.**

Its purpose is to give immediate and helpful feedback about whether a student is
doing their proof correctly, so that the student learns the mechanics and rules
of proof writing more quickly and thoroughly than if they had to wait days for
manually graded feedback.

## Current status

The latest version of Lurch is a web application that is in alpha testing at the
moment.  [You can try it online here,](http://lurchmath.github.io/lurchmath)
but right now there is very little documentation, and new bug fixes and feature
additions happen literally every day.  Expect a more stable release in late
spring of 2024.

Potential new contributors can check out
[the new app's GitHub repository here](http://www.github.com/lurchmath/lurchmath).

## Other tools

 * [The Lurch Deductive Engine (LDE)](http://github.com/lurchmath/lde) is the
   set of data structures and algorithms used under the hood to validate proofs
 * We may later incorporate
   [this JavaScript implementation](http://lurchmath.github.io/earley-parser)
   of the [Earley parsing algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earley_parser)
   to allow users to customize the notation used in the app, but that remains
   uncertain.
 * Old versions of our work are archived [here](old-versions.md).
